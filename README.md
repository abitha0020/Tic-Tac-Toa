# Tic-Tac-Toa
## Project Description
The Tic Tac Toe Web Game is a simple, interactive web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It allows two players to input their names and then play the game on a 3x3 grid. The game tracks the state of the board, checks for winning conditions, and displays the game status to the players. The project showcases basic web development skills, including HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
